    <div class="container" id="aboutme">
      <div class="copy">
      <p> So i'm a 32-year-old gen Y that, like many, have they looming question constantly floating around... What am i doing with my money!<br /><br /><b>AM I RIGHT?</b><br /><br />After hearing and reading so much about Bitcoin in the news, online and socials, I thought, stuff it! I have some spare change, let's roll the dice and see what happens.<br /><br /> Now, When this topic comes up at dinner parties everyone is always interested along with a ton of questions, so, I thought I would document my attempt at Bitcoin.
        <h4>So... who am I? Who I'm not!</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>I’m not a financial expert.</li>
          <li>I’m not a trained professional.</li>
          <li>I’m not a broker</li>
          <li>and I’m not giving advice</li>
        </ul>
          <p>This is my journey into Bitcoin and how i got to this point so far from pure experimenting. I heard about Bitcoin like you so I’m giving it a go! You should seek your own financial advise.
            <br /><br />What I will say is that the only money I’ve put in, is what I’m prepared to lose. This might not be right for you, and you should definitely do your research!
            <br>Bitcoin is volatile, and it could crash and it all be all over tomorrow along with the money. <br />So if you’re interested, spend with what you can afford to walk away from. I’m not putting my house on Bitcoin. <b><u>Yet</u></b>.

      <h2  style="color: #ff5c5c; font-size: 40px; text-align: center;">Question #1...What is Bitcoin?</h2>
        <p style="text-align: center;">It’s crypto currency, meaning it’s currency that lives online. You can't feel it, you can't touch it, you can't hold it!<br />
        <br /><b style="font-size: 20px;">Yes</b><br />It’s a form of currency.<br />
        <br /><b style="font-size: 20px;">Yes</b><br />You can convert it to hard currency (called Fiat currency) like USD, AUD and any single currency in the world.<br />
        <br /><b style="font-size: 20px;">Yes</b><br />You can buy real things likes beers, products and even houses with it.<br />
        <br /><b style="font-size: 20px;">Yes</b><br />There are Bitcoin ATM’s popping up all around the globe.<br /></p>

        <div class="pro">
          <h3>What’s Bitcoin’s advantage?</h3>
            <p>It’s decentralised! It’s not tied to any one government, country or body of people meaning it’s left to its own devices. It's only worth what people are willing to pay for it. <br /><br>It’s a political safe haven when a country or government landscape could be in uproar. Bitcoin’s value is driven from supply and demand!</p>
        </div>
        <div class="con">
          <h3>What’s it’s disadvantages?</h3>
            <p>Because it is decentralised, it could all crash tomorrow with no notice and the dream will be over.<br><br> Which is why I'm only play with what you can afford to lose!</p>

        <div class="copy">
          <p>I’m buying packages through a mining company called USI Tech.<br /><br />Basically, what happens is I buy a (1) package from USI-Tech worth the equivilant of €50 in Bitcoin. Each package lasts for approx. 140 business days.
          <br><br>What USI-Tech do is give me 140% return on my capital for that one package and they return approx. 1% to me per day in bitcoin.<br /><br /> I say "approx. 140 business days" becuase it's until 140% return is reached. One day can return anywhere from 0.75% to 1.25% therefor it could be more or less than 140 business days. So, if you work on approx. 1% per business day = 140 business days.<br /><br />That 1% per day, I'm free to either let it compound and build up over time and withdraw as I like <u><b>or</b></u> I can use it to rebuy another package when my balance reached the equivilate of €50 in bitcoin. <br><br>While they return 140% worth of my initial captial, here is the even better news, it doesn’t take into account if the value of bitcoin goes up since my first puchase because they pay in bitcoin. If Bitcoin goes up, my return is greater than 140%.</p>

I'm now averaging buying 16 packages a week (at €50 each)!<br /><br />I have to say, I've been pretty happy so far and on top of that, bitcoin has continued to go up, since I’ve started this little project.</b></p>

          <p>I'm playing a long term game here, so at the end of my 140 (ish) business days, will I get my exact $3,000 back? Not exactly because I've used my daily returns to rebuy back into USI-TECH.<br /> <br /> Had i not used my returns to buy additional packages, I could absoultly, let it build up and I could walk way with my $3,000 plus the additional 40% and call it a day. But I'm not.<br /><br /> I’m using my returns as I get it and I’m pumping the money back into the system to build those package numbers up. This increases the amount of returns I’m getting daily; The more packges the more daily returns (with all packages returning a 1% return per day) and the speed to which i do it.<br /> <br /> I will get to a point in my initial 140 days however, where I’ll stop buying packages with my returns and let my returns accumulate into my initial $3,000; cash that out, and start again on my pure return on capital.</p>
