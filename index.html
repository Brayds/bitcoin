      <div class="copy">
      <p> So i'm a 32-year-old gen Y that, like many, have they looming question constantly floating around... What am i doing with my money!<br /><br /><b>Am i right?</b><br /><br />After hearing and reading so much about Bitcoin in the news, online and socials that I thought, stuff it! I have some spare change, let's roll the dice and see what happens.<br /><br /> Now, When this topic comes up at dinner parties everyone is always interested along with a ton of questions, so, I thought I would document my attempt at Bitcoin.
        <h4>So... who am I? Who I'm not!</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>I’m not a financial expert.</li>
          <li>I’m not trained professional.</li>
          <li>I’m not a broker</li>
          <li>and I’m not giving advice</li>
        </ul>
          <p>This is my journey into Bitcoin and how i got to this point so far from pure experimenting. I heard about Bitcoin like you so I’m giving it a go! You should seek your own financial advise.
            <br /><br />What I will say is that the only money I’ve put in, is what I’m prepared to lose. This might not be right for you, and you should definitely do your research!
            <br>Bitcoin is volatile, and it could crash and it all be all over tomorrow along with the money. <br />So if you’re interested, spend with what you can afford to walk away from. I’m not putting my house on Bitcoin. <b><u>Yet</u></b>.

      <h2  style="color: #ff5c5c; font-size: 40px; text-align: center;">Question #1...What is Bitcoin?</h2>
        <p style="text-align: center;">It’s crypto currency, meaning it’s currency that lives online. You can't feel it, you can't touch it, you can't hold it!<br />
        <br /><b style="font-size: 20px;">Yes</b><br />It’s real money but not hard physical money.<br />
        <br /><b style="font-size: 20px;">Yes</b><br />You can convert it to hard currency like USD, AUD and any single currency in the world.<br />
        <br /><b style="font-size: 20px;">Yes</b><br />You can buy real things likes beers, products and even houses with it.<br />
        <br /><b style="font-size: 20px;">Yes</b><br />There are Bitcoin ATM’s popping up all around the globe.<br /></p>

          <h3>What’s Bitcoin’s advantage?</h3>
            <p>It’s decentralised! It’s not tied to any one government, country or body of people meaning it’s left to its own devices. <br /><br>It’s a political safe haven when a country or government landscape could be in uproar. Bitcoin’s value is driven from supply and demand!</p>
        </div>
        <div class="con">
          <h3>What’s it’s disadvantages?</h3>
            <p>Because it is decentralised, it could all crash tomorrow with no notice and the dream will be over.<br><br> Which is why I'm only play with what you can afford to lose!</p>

        <p>A whole stack of people/computers called miners (who mining for Bitcoin) who collectively record every single bitcoin transaction that happens.<br><br>This is stored on something called the block chain. The block chain gets updated in real-time by the minors.<br><br>When a transaction happens, the transaction gets announced into the bitcoin eco system in the form of a puzzle/code. The first person/computer to crack the number puzzle/code gets a fee for doing it the fastest. They then update the block chain with the transaction details and the world keeps turning.<br><br> Rather than me expalin in depth, this video does a pretty good job at it.</p>

    <h2  style="color: #ff5c5c; font-size: 40px; text-align: center;">So, should we talk money?</h2>
    <div class="talkmoney">

        <h3>So how is bitcoin performing?</h3>
          <p>(Insert graph)</p>
        <h3>So how much a Business day roughly am I making?</h3>
          <p>As of October XX, I’m making approx XX Bitcoin a Business day which works out to be €XX or USD$XX as of (1st October 2017).</p>
        <h3>How am I doing it?</h3>
          <p>I’m buying contracts (their real name is packages) through a mining company called USI Tech. Basically, what happens is I buy a contract from USI-Tech worth €50 but paid in bitcoin (pending what the currency exchange it) and the contract lasts for 140 Days. What USI-Tech claim to do is give me 140% return on capital for that one package. They pay 1% per day... i.e daily returns you can either compound or withdraw as you like. What it doesn’t take into account is if the value of bitcoin goes up (as they pay in bitcoin). So if the value of bitcoin goes up, so does your returns. </p>
        <h3>So how much did I put in?</h3>
          <p>Initially, I put AU$3,000 (USD$2,332) into USI-Tech. I figured, throw a decent sum and see what happens, knowing full well, Bitcoin (Or USI-Tech) could all be gone tomorrow. So far, xxx days since starting (insert date) i have gotten back xxxBitcoin which is USD$xxx AU$xxx  €xxx...However, As I get my returns back, I have been re-investing it back into USI-Tech each time I acrew €50. €50 = one package.So I started with 50 packages (it should have been 40 packages however I got 10 for free) and now, xxx days since starting (insert date) i have xx packages. This is going well as over time, bitcoin has continued to go up, since I’ve started this little project. </p>
        <h3>Am I going to get my $2,000 back?</h3>
          <p>The way I’m doing it, Initially, no. And it took me to start doing it, throwing my money in, and feeling out the system to understand. I eventually will get it back, but it’s a long term plan and it took some working out to realise. I’m reinvesting my returns as I get it and I’m pumping the money back into the system to build those package numbers up. This increases the amount of returns I’m getting and the speed to which i do it. Could I just ride the 140 days out, and cash out, yep, absolutely but I’m playing a long term game here. I will get to a point in my initial 140 days however, where I’ll stop reinvesting my returns into more packages and let my returns accumulate into my initial $3,000; cash that out, and start again on my pure return on capital. I’m going to do this around the 100 day point. </p>
