    <div class="container" id="aboutme">
      <div class="copy">
      <p> So i'm a 32-year-old gen Y that, like many, have they looming question constantly floating around... What am i doing with my money!<br /><br /><b>Am i right?</b><br /><br />After hearing and reading so much about Bitcoin in the news, online and socials that I thought, stuff it! I have some spare change, let's roll the dice and see what happens.<br /><br /> Now, When this topic comes up at dinner parties everyone is always interested along with a ton of questions, so, I thought I would document my attempt at Bitcoin.
        <h4>So... who am I? Who I'm not!</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>I’m not a financial expert.</li>
          <li>I’m not trained professional.</li>
          <li>I’m not a broker</li>
          <li>and I’m not giving advice</li>
        </ul>
          <p>This is my journey into Bitcoin and how i got to this point so far from pure experimenting. I heard about Bitcoin like you so I’m giving it a go! You should seek your own financial advise.
            <br /><br />What I will say is that the only money I’ve put in, is what I’m prepared to lose. This might not be right for you, and you should definitely do your research!
            <br>Bitcoin is volatile, and it could crash and it all be all over tomorrow along with the money. <br />So if you’re interested, spend with what you can afford to walk away from. I’m not putting my house on Bitcoin. <b><u>Yet</u></b>.

      <h2  style="color: #ff5c5c; font-size: 40px; text-align: center;">Question #1...What is Bitcoin?</h2>
        <p style="text-align: center;">It’s crypto currency, meaning it’s currency that lives online. You can't feel it, you can't touch it, you can't hold it!<br />
        <br /><b style="font-size: 20px;">Yes</b><br />It’s real money but not hard physical money.<br />
        <br /><b style="font-size: 20px;">Yes</b><br />You can convert it to hard currency like USD, AUD and any single currency in the world.<br />
        <br /><b style="font-size: 20px;">Yes</b><br />You can buy real things likes beers, products and even houses with it.<br />
        <br /><b style="font-size: 20px;">Yes</b><br />There are Bitcoin ATM’s popping up all around the globe.<br /></p>

          <h3>What’s Bitcoin’s advantage?</h3>
            <p>It’s decentralised! It’s not tied to any one government, country or body of people meaning it’s left to its own devices. <br /><br>It’s a political safe haven when a country or government landscape could be in uproar. Bitcoin’s value is driven from supply and demand!</p>
        </div>
        <div class="con">
          <h3>What’s it’s disadvantages?</h3>
            <p>Because it is decentralised, it could all crash tomorrow with no notice and the dream will be over.<br><br> Which is why I'm only play with what you can afford to lose!</p>

        <p>A whole stack of people/computers called miners (who mining for Bitcoin) who collectively record every single bitcoin transaction that happens.<br><br>This is stored on something called the block chain. The block chain gets updated in real-time by the minors.<br><br>When a transaction happens, the transaction gets announced into the bitcoin eco system in the form of a puzzle/code. The first person/computer to crack the number puzzle/code gets a fee for doing it the fastest. They then update the block chain with the transaction details and the world keeps turning.<br><br> Rather than me expalin in depth, this video does a pretty good job at it.</p>

      <h2 style="color: #ff5c5c; font-size: 40px; text-align: center;">So let's go back to the orginal numbers...</h2>
      <div id="subheading">
        <h2>My return on Captial</h2>
        <h2 style="font-size: 50px;"> is USD $150 a day*</h2>
        <p style="text-align: right; font-size: 10px;"><i>*based on a 5 day week on average as of November 2017 </i></p>
      </div>
      <h2 style="color: #ff5c5c; font-size: 40px; text-align: center;">How am I doing it?!?</h2>
          <p>I’m buying contracts (their real name is packages) through a mining company called USI Tech. Basically, what happens is I buy a contract from USI-Tech worth €50 which is paid back to me in bitcoin. Each pack (or contract) lasts for 140 Days.
            <br><br>What USI-Tech claim to do is give me 140% return on capital for that one package returning 1% per day paid in bitcoin. With that 1% you're free to either let it compound, withdraw as you like or use it to rebuy pacakges. <br><br>What it doesn’t take into account is if the value of bitcoin goes up, (as they pay in bitcoin), so does your returns. </p>
        <h2 style="color: #ff5c5c; font-size: 40px; text-align: center;">So how much did I put in?</h2>
          <p>Initially, I put AU$3,000 (USD$2,332) into USI-Tech. I figured, throw a decent sum and see what happens, knowing full well, Bitcoin (Or USI-Tech) could all be gone tomorrow. So far, xxx days since starting (insert date) i have gotten back xxxBitcoin which is USD$xxx AU$xxx  €xxx...However, As I get my returns back, I have been re-investing it back into USI-Tech each time I acrew €50. €50 = one package.So I started with 50 packages (it should have been 40 packages however I got 10 for free) and now, xxx days since starting (insert date) i have xx packages. This is going well as over time, bitcoin has continued to go up, since I’ve started this little project. </p>
        <h2 style="color: #ff5c5c; font-size: 40px; text-align: center;">Am I going to get my $2,000 back?</h2>
          <p>The way I’m doing it, Initially, no. And it took me to start doing it, throwing my money in, and feeling out the system to understand. I eventually will get it back, but it’s a long term plan and it took some working out to realise. I’m reinvesting my returns as I get it and I’m pumping the money back into the system to build those package numbers up. This increases the amount of returns I’m getting and the speed to which i do it. Could I just ride the 140 days out, and cash out, yep, absolutely but I’m playing a long term game here. I will get to a point in my initial 140 days however, where I’ll stop reinvesting my returns into more packages and let my returns accumulate into my initial $3,000; cash that out, and start again on my pure return on capital. I’m going to do this around the 100 day point. </p>
